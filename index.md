## About Me
I am a tenacious, highly organized problem solver that is always looking for ways to improve. I enjoy learning, whether through formal classes or self-study.

I have experience with maintaining Linux and Windows servers for application servers, as well as to support other business services. As part of the DevOps team, I have been contributing to our development of continuous integration and delivery, and working to improve our observability and scalability. My experience with programming languages such as Java, C#, JavaScript, and SQL has helped with troubleshooting application issues, as well as creating scripts to automate administrative functions and manage data.

My goals for the near future include continuing to learn programming skills, how those skills can solve problems across disciplines, and to contribute to the further integration of development, system administration, and security practices.
